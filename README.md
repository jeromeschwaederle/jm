## Why build this project

### A way to give majority judgment publicity

Not so many people know about the [majority judgment voting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment).

Building a tool using it was for me a way of understanding it. And moreover a way to let other people try and experiment with it

### A deep interest in the underlying subject

The question of voting systems and how decision and consensus can be reached in a group of heterogeneous individuals is something that I find fascinating.

So much so that my final project for cs50 was a [python implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCPWqXPRzuU) of the majority judgment voting system with a terminal interface.

### Wanting to use it on my phone

A terminal interface is definitely not ideal in terms of user experience.

I wanted to make a second version that I could use on my phone. And that anyone could use or test on their phone, tablet or computer whether it is a mac, pc and android platform.

### A worthy algoritmic challenge

Getting a deep understanding of the tie-breacking rule of the majority judgment system is not trivial.

Hacking a reliable [code](https://github.com/jeromeschwaederle/jm/blob/master/src/store/algo.js) version of it is even less so, no matter the langage you use (python or JavaScript).
